## Linux Update Script.
This is a script for updating linux.

### Couple quick things.
1. This is written to run in #!bin/sh.
2. This can be modified to be run as an anacron process.
3. This is for people who are not affraid to break everything after an update.
4. This is just something I use at home not an enterprise environment.
5. Change every insance of "Machine" to your current machine name to control logging.
6. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
