## Linux Update Script.
This is a script for updating linux.

### Couple quick things.
1. This is written to run in #!bin/sh.
2. This is written to be able to run as an anacron process.
3. This is for people who are not affraid to break everything after an update.
4. This does NOT autoremove things.
5. This is just something I use at home not an enterprise environment.
